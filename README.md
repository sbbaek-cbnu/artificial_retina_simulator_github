# Video2Spike Retina Simulator
Conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model which converts pixel intensity input (from images/videos) into Rhodopsin/photoisomerizations per second. The simulator returns a transient analysis of ion current response, membrane potential and conductance evolution of each retina cell.

## Getting Started
Download all files in vid2spike folder.
Keep all files in the same relative path.
Run RetinaModelSimulator.exe (64-bit). Intended for external webcam use.
