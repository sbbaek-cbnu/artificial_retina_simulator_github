# artificial_retina_simulator_github
Cellular network retina simulator which accepts light input in the form of Rhodopsin & photoisomerization molecules activated per second, returning a transient analysis of ionic current response and membrane potentials of retina cells.

## Getting Started
An executable binary (32- and 64-bit) of the simulator is provided for immediate use of the simulator.
The source code of the model is also included as a VS2010 project.
